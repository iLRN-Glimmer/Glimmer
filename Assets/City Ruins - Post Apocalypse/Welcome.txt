Thank you for purchasing the Stylized City Ruins Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
Multiple Demo and Showcase scenes are included aswell.


If you like the package I would really appreciate a small review on the product page!
I hope you'll have fun with your project!



Tip:
Use the Post Processing Stack and switch to Linear Color Space for better visuals (Availabe for free as a Unity Plugin)
